## Test Instructions:
Scroll down to the questions sections and click my deployed link. It will take the user to the app where they can either continue their workout or create a new one.  After completing a workout, it will bring you back to the home page and there you will see the last workout done. If the user clicks the dashboard, there the user will see the stats by day of total duration of minutes per day and pounds per day for their workout along with the list of workouts. Or if you want to run it on your local, then copy my repo(scroll down to questions section to see the repo link) click on it and copy my repo and copy it to your drive. open it up with vscode, go to the terminal, and install dependencies by typing: npm install. Then type: node server.js to start the server. Click on the link for localhost and it will take the user to the app.

## Demo:


## Challenges: 
Lots of challenges in this assignment. Issues with the routes; thought my routes were wrong. Anytime I added or completed an exercise, it would return back an emptry array and database would show zero values. Updating was difficult, proper syntax, but after reading the documents it wasn't too bad. Spent hours with a classmate trying to figure out what was wrong but we were able to figure it out in the end. Another issue was deployment. I followed the steps correctly. Spent time with the TA's to figure out what was the problem. After taking some time off to clear my head realized that atlas didn't like the password I created. After that, deployment is fully functional with no errors.
